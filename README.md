Hi! This is BlockTrackUtils and it's super cool!

## What is BlockTrackUtils?

BlockTrackUtils is a special computer program that helps you see if someone got banned. It tells you why they got banned and even shows all the old names they used. It's like magic!

## Features

- **See Bans!**: It tells you why a player got banned.
- **Old Names**: It shows you a list of all the old names someone had.

## How to Play (Setup)

1. **Get NodeJS**: Ask a grown-up to help you install NodeJS. Make sure to choose the LTS (long term) version.
2. **Decompile**: Open up the code and take it apart like a fun puzzle.
3. **Install Stuff**: Open your command box and type `npm install` to get everything you need.
4. **Run the Program**: Type `node server.js` to start BlockTrackUtils.
5. **Visit It**: Open your web magic box (browser) and go to `localhost:3000` (you can change the port if you want).

## Cool Commands

- **/prv**: See the old names that were checked.
- **/check <PlayerUsername>**: Check if a player's name is banned.
- **/eraseusernames**: Clean up the messy old names and free up space!

Have fun and enjoy playing with BlockTrackUtils!
